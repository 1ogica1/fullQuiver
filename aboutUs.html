				<h2>About Our Company</h2>
				<div id="aboutUsPageDiv">
					<p>
						<strong>Full Quiver</strong> is a whole online archery resale company. Every piece of our inventory is hand crafted and is of the top quality archery supplies on the market.
					</p>
					<p>
						Originally <strong>Full Quiver</strong> started as a small store located in Shintotsukawa, Japan. 
						Back in the 1870s when we firstly opened we crafted all of our items ourselves. 
						Through-out the years <strong>Full Quiver</strong> has been the leading brand for hand crafted archery supplies.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the 1950s <strong>Full Quiver</strong> expanded outside of Japan. We expanded into the Americas and Europe.
						We had nearly 650 stores located all over these areas. Each store had all of the proper tools for creating the archery supplies that were sold.
						Creating our own archery supplies was our prime goal, we would not lose sight of this.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now in the year 2014 we have sadly moved away from stores. We have gone completely online. We have moved our headquarters into Canada.
						Through our online store we will not be shipping outside of Canada. We still take pride in crafting all of our archery supplies.
						We have created other brands that specify in crafting the different products of our store.
